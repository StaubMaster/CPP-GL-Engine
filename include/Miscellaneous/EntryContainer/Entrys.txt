maybe make them a Linked List ?

the reason why there are EntryContainer::Entry and EntryContainer::EntryData
is becaus one needs to be an allocated pointer
so that both sides can point to the same thing

the reason I dont just use a regular Container::Binary is because reallocating would change the address

but a linked list would also use pointers so it would only change how the pointers are stored
