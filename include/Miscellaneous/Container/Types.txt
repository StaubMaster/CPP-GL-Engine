UnCounting (_Limit is constant) (_Count == _Limit)
	Array()		internal Data. Copy. needs Limit to allocate
	Pointer()	external Data. Bind. needs Limit and Pointer

Counting (_Limit changes)
	Dynamic()		internal Data. Copy. Binary Size
	Tight()			internal Data. Copy. Limit == _Count
	Fixed()			internal Data. Copy. fixed Size. needs Limit to allocate
	Fixed()			external Data. Bind. fixed Size. needs Limit and Data pointer
