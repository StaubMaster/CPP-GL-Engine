BufferArray with EntryContainer is a Main PolyHedra with multiple Instances

a Manager holds multiple Main PolyHedra each with multiple Instances

the only similarity is that MainData and InstData is the same
but with multiple Objects
and a Single Shader





PolyHedra_Simple3D_Manager
{
	Shader
	Container::Dynamic<PolyHedra_Simple3D_Buffer_Manager>
}



PolyHedra_Simple3D_Buffer_Manager
{
	PolyHedra
	BufferArray
	EntryContainer
}
this one handles a single PolyHedra with a single BufferArray
stores Instances
