Image
	change to be like Buffers
	so they get used without Pointers
	normally only the Pointer to the Data gets passed arount
	the Data only gets deleted when Dispose() is called
Image()			NULL Image
Image(w, h)		allocates Image
Image(other)	copys Members
~Image()		does nothing ?





Dispose()
	am I even using that word correctly ?
	"Performs application-defined tasks associated with freeing, releasing, or resetting unmanaged resources."
	is probably correct





Generic Parse:
to load a PNG you need to call "LoadImagePNG()"
make a generic "LoadImage()" that internally checks the Image type
so if extension is ".png" or ".PNG" then use "LoadImagePNG"
if extension is unknown then return NULL ?





LineCommand Parser
"inside"	LineCommand functions
"outside"	where the LineCommand stuff is used

currently the names need to be checked "outside"
and then the count needs to be checked "outside"
set that stuff in the beginning and then check "inside"



Problem:
some funcitons might "turn on" other functions
so Skin can only be probably parsed once "Skin" is known

make it so "Type" and "Format" are hardcoded inside the Parser

how to other Parsers work
most are just hardcoded
and dont change

maybe Parse "Type" and "Format"
then give that to a "ParserInitFunc"
that then sets all the Functions to use ?



Type and Format are expected to be at the beginning
and can both only have 1 Value

put them together
so the beginning of the File needs to be:
"Type"'\n'"Format"'\n'

for Skin
make Type the Type of Skin
that what it dose already :|

dont have this stuff be hardcoded
isntead have a function called "ParseTypeFormat()"
that returns Type and Foramt





FileInfo
Directory()
	currently return a string
	should return a DirectoryInfo
DirectoryString()
	should return the string



FileInfo and DirectoryInfo
	should be able to create subDirectorys needed for the current



DirectoryInfo Collection
	have a collection of Directorys
	then getting a File, look through all the Directorys
	usually User specified stuff should be checked first
	have 2 Lists, User and Auto
	have a way to specify Priority ?



Path:
	right now it stores a vector of string
	maybe just store 1 char *
	and an array of the sections between the '/'
