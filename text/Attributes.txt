Attributes
currently the Buffer takes some stuff
including data_size
then the Attributes all use the same data_size
and also the same Divisor
and their individual Index

make it so Divisor is given to Buffer
and the Attribute takes Buffer (*this)
and then get data_size and Divisor from that

also the Contructor of the Buffer
needs to Allocate the Attributes Container
and then set all the Attributes individually

make the Container a :Binary
and make the Attributes Insert themselves
like Uniforms

the Container might be too big ?
and waste space

but there shouldnt be that many Attributes
(below 16, generally)

also Shader does the same
